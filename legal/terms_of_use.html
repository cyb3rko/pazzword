<h3>Terms of Use</h3>
<p>
    By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before
    using the app. You’re only allowed to copy, or modify the app, in any way if using a license compatible to the 'MIT License' and
    attributing me.<br/>
    The app itself still belongs to Cyb3rKo.<br/><br/>

    The Pazzword app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your
    phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software
    restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
    malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Pazzword app won’t work properly or at
    all.<br/><br/>

    The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms of Use (or Terms and Conditions).<br/>
    Link to Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the app:

<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;<a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
    You should be aware that there are certain things that I will not take responsibility for. I cannot always take responsibility for the way you use
    the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, I
    cannot accept responsibility.<br/>

    With respect to my responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although I endeavour to
    ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, I do rely on third parties to provide information to me so that I can make it available to
    you. I accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.<br/>

    At some point, I may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for system (and for any additional
    systems I decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app.
    I do not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on
    your device. I may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
    Unless I tell you otherwise, upon any termination,<br/>
    (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;<br/>
    (b) you must stop using the app, and delete it from your device.

<h5>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h5>
<p>
    I may update my Terms of Use from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review it periodically for any changes. I will notify you of
    any changes by posting a comment on the 'Recent changes' section on the Google Play Store or the release page on the GitHub repository
    (<a href="https://github.com/cyb3rko/pazzword/releases">click here</a>).<br/>
    <strong>These Terms of Use are effective as of 2022-08-30.</strong>
