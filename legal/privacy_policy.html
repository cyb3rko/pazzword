<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>
    I built the Pazzword app as an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by Cyb3rKo at no cost and is intended for use as is.<br/><br/>

    This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to
    use this Service.<br/><br/>

    If you choose to use this Service and if you explicitly allow the data collection, then you agree to the collection and use of information in
    relation to this policy.<br/>
    The Personal Information that I collect is used for improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone
    except as described in this Privacy Policy.<br/><br/>
</p>
<h5>Information Collection and Use</h5>
<p>
    The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you, provided that you allow data collection.<br/>
    Link to privacy policy of third party service providers used by the app:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li>
</ul>
<h5>Cookies</h5>
<p>
    Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the
    websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.<br/>
    This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect
    information and improve their services.
</p>
<h5>Links to Websites</h5>
<p>
    This Service may contain links to websites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that not every of these
    external sites are operated by me.<br/>
    Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and
    assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
</p>
<h5>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h5>

    I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of
    any changes by posting a comment on the 'Recent changes' section on the Google Play Store or the release page on the GitHub repository
